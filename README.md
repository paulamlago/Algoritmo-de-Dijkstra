# Dijkstra-Algorithm

This algorithm finds the shortest paths between the first node and the remining ones in a given Graph.
In this repository you will find:
  - Two .cpp, one solves the algorithm using a vector, and the other one solves it with a binary heap.
  - A .pdf with the explanations of the algorithms, some execution examples, an graphs showing the costs of both of them.
  - A .txt, which is an example of a graph, represented as a matrix. This is the imput of the program, but you can change it and try different graphs!
